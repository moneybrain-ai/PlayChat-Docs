## Test

You can take the chatbot you developed for a test drive on the PlayChat page. Confirm if the chatbot operates properly through the tests, and modify weaknesses. The chatbot test can be carried on through the chatbot test dialog window, while checking the log windows at the same time.

## Dialog Window

There is a dialog window ready on the right screen. You can check if the chatbot is responding properly by interacting with the chatbot. If you continue the test with the dialog scenario screen open, the card that is being activated will be high-lighted.

* Click on the round arrow on the upper left of the dialog window for the bot to be updated. The changes made in the dialog scenario will be reflected in the bot.

* Click on the ‘X’ on the upper right of the dialog window to make the window invisible.

## Real-time Dialog Analysis

A real-time dialog analysis window is ready at the bottom screen. Whilst you interact with the chatbot in the test dialog window, you can check the analysis of the chatbot user’s input, the corresponding intents and entities, execute functions and chatbot responses.
